(Needs updating)

* Sprites : .spr files*
A Sprite file contains all the data concerning an actor which will include:
    - animation definitions
    - a url to one or more PNG image files containing animation sequences
    - the metadata concerning the frames inside the image file:
        - bounding box of actor frame
        - relative positions of each frame and frame id
        - center position

* Maps : .map files *
A map is a text file that describes an area of space where actors may exist
    - file url to an image of the actual map players will see
    - file url to an image of the black/white collision information
    - portals which point to other portals in the same or different maps
    - a starting template of actors and their starting conditions
    - a list of actors that is saved when the map is exited, and used when loaded
